# Cybersecurity Threat Map (DSA Project)

This project models a network as a graph using adjacency lists in C.
It detects suspicious nodes (devices with unusually high connections)
and visualizes connections in the terminal.

## Features
- Graph representation using adjacency lists
- Anomaly detection (flagging suspicious devices)
- CSV file integration for persistent connections
- Random connection simulation mode
- Menu-driven interface

## How to Run
```bash
gcc main.c -o threatmap
./threatmap
